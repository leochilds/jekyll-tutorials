# Configuration

Go to your config.yml file. You should see the following:

    # Site settings
    title: Your awesome title
    email: your-email@domain.com
    description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
      Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
      line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
      Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
    baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
    url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
    twitter_username: jekyllrb
    github_username:  jekyll

    # Build settings
    markdown: kramdown
    
Edit the title, email, description, twitter username and github username. You can edit baseurl and url at a later time when your site is hosted on GitHub or elsewhere. Preview your site to see changes.
