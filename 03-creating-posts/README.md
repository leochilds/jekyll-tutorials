# Creating Blog Posts

Go to your site and open the posts directory. Open the file 2014-03-21-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown. The first 6 lines should read:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
    date:   2014-08-21 11:03:14
    categories: jekyll update

This is how Jekyll uses layouts to structure your website. By creating a new markdown file in the posts directory you can create a new post that will appear on the index page and on another page dedicated to the post. Try now, create a new file in the format of yyyy-mm-dd-my-first-blog-post.markdown and in that file put in the first 6 lines:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  "My First Blog Post!"
    date:   yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
    categories: General
    ---
    
Feel free to write something on the 7th line, save and preview your site.
